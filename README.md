# Game-Me-and-My-Hat
A 2-D action-adventure sandbox game inspired by Terraria, Minecraft and Don't Starve Together. Only this time, I can add all the features I like.

# Plan for the game:
## Tools:
I am planning to use C++ wih SFML for this project, and the first step is to have a runable game on Mac OS.

# How to play:
## Movement: 
### normal UpDownLeftRight
### Sliding: in the sliding mode, the player will keep moving along a direction, and the controls for the direction now becomes the direction of the weapon.

## Control:
### Toggle Split Screen: E
### Player1: movement: WASD, sliding: Num2, shoot: Num1
### Player2: movement: UpDownLeftRight, sliding: ], shoot: [

## Ideas:
A 2-D creature who loves hats(hence the title). The creature lives in a 2-D surface, it is shown on the screen by its hat. 

## Detailed Plans: 
### The world:
- The whole world is a 2-D universe, where the player start at an earth-like 2-D planet, but can later on build rockets to go to other planets.
- Each planet is a 2-D square, with some resources and enimes. 
- The movement for the spacecraft in the outer space follows the same physical rule as in real life(only in 2D). 
### The weapons:
- This game should have insane design in weapon customization: the players can customize their own weapons with the combination of several features. The one that I currently have in mind is the Crescent Rose from RWBY. 
### The abilities:
- I am also thinking about something similar to the devil fruits as in One Piece.
### The players:
- The player is only of a simple geometric shape(circle, triangle), which is the shape of their hats.
- The player should have some stats to maintain(similar to the hunger, sanity and health in DST).
### 

## TODOs:
- add accelaration to make the movement smooth
- randomly generalized background
- player to 2 sub class
- player.isMoving
- default direction of weapon while sliding
- bullet class
